# Static Logo Assets

This folder contains logo images that remain static for ADAPT and are consistent across all instances, regardless of branding configurations.

## Purpose

These logos serve as the core visual identity elements that:
- Maintain consistent branding across all ADAPT deployments
- Remain unchanged regardless of custom theming or instance-specific configurations
- Provide standardized assets for use throughout the application

## Usage

Place static logo files in this directory that should be universally available across all ADAPT instances without modification.
